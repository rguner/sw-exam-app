.gitignore file added. Because target and .idea folder shouldn't store to the repository
Lombok integreted to Customer, Person, TranslateResponseDto, SayHelloResponseDto model classes.
I divided controller class into four seperete class. CustomerController, PersonController, SayHalleController, TranslateController
I extracted usage of repository classes from controller classes. I created service classes. CustomerService, PersonService, SayHalleService, TranslateService
ElementNotFoundException was created for giving information that doesn't exist in database.
sayhello method in SayHelloService was redesigned. I used StringBuilder instead of string concat. Because, string is an immutable class.
ControllerExceptionAdvice was created. It catches some exceptions like ElementNotFoundException, RuntimeException and returns specified http return codes.
Translate service was redesigned. I used hashMap to store numbers and values instead of switch block.
I created dto models for input and output. CustomerRequestDto, SayHelloResponseDto
I added validation annotations to CustomerRequestDto for input validation. I added to ControllerExceptionAdvice class a new method for catching MethodArgumentNotValidException validation errors.
I created InitConfiguration @Configuration class for environment specific behavior.
Unit tests were created for Service and Controller classes. Coverage is %100 for these classes.
LoggingInterceptor was added for logging request uri and response status.
